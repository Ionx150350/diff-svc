Verse 1
Up to the sky, up to the cloud and sea, baby
One love, our love, one love
Love is whatever they say
Loves they say

Pre-Chorus
We love you, we need you
Oh through and through

Chorus
Hearts get stuck in love, tongues get lost in love
Hearts get stuck in love, tongues get lost in love
Hearts get stuck in love, tongues get lost in love
Hearts get stuck in love, tongues get lost in love

Verse 2
Baby, deep down I wanted to give myself to you
I got deep down and lost my mind
But then I found true love in you
I got deep down and lost my mind

Pre-Chorus
I feel like I just saw my love last night
He dances near and the ladies like him

Chorus
Hearts get stuck in love, tongues get lost in love
Hearts get stuck in love, tongues get lost in love
Hearts get stuck in love, tongues get lost in love
Hearts get stuck in love, tongues get lost in love

Bridge
You know you heard a couple records
You know you love a couple records

Chorus
Hearts get stuck in love, tongues get lost in love
Hearts get stuck in love, tongues get lost in love
Hearts get stuck in love, tongues get lost in love
Hearts get stuck in love, tongues get lost in love
